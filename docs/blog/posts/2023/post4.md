## The Pull Request Dashboard

GitHub's latest update has revolutionized the way developers handle pull requests. The Pull Request Dashboard provides an interactive and streamlined experience, making it easier than ever to manage and review incoming changes. With this dashboard, you can quickly see all your open pull requests and filter them by repository, assignee, or label. You can also choose which ones to merge or close without having to go through individual conversations. This powerful tool helps streamline the process, saving you time and effort in the long run. With this new dashboard, you can easily keep track of all your incoming changes, allowing for a smoother development workflow.

## Improved Notifications

GitHub recently announced improved notifications to keep you up to date on what’s happening with your projects. You can now choose to receive notifications on issues, pull requests, commits, and project boards as they happen. This helps keep you informed of changes and activity that require your attention.
The new notifications also include improved filtering options to help you manage the volume of notifications and focus on what is important. You can filter notifications by repository, type of event, user, or even the branch. You can even create custom filters to personalize your notifications further.
GitHub also improved the way they display notifications. Each one has an improved summary and rich media previews so you can quickly see what changed.
With these new improved notifications, it's easier than ever to stay up to date with your projects and keep your development workflow running smoothly.

## Unified Search

GitHub’s latest update includes a new feature called “Unified Search.” This feature allows users to search through repositories, issues, and users simultaneously from one place. By typing a search query into the search bar, users can view all relevant results within GitHub. This makes it easier for users to quickly locate content, saving them time and energy.
When using Unified Search, results are automatically organized by relevance and type. Users can also filter search results using various criteria such as language, repository name, topic, and more. The search can be further refined with specific keywords or tags that users have added to their repositories and issues.
Unified Search is a valuable new tool that helps GitHub users quickly find the information they need. With this feature, users no longer have to switch between multiple tabs or pages in order to find what they’re looking for. Instead, they can quickly narrow down their search results and find the content they need in no time.
