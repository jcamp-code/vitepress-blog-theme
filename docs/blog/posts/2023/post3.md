It's been a long time since HTML has seen any major updates, but the wait is finally over. HTML 5.2 has arrived, bringing with it a slew of changes and improvements. If you're a web developer or web designer, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the latest HTML standards. In this blog post, we'll explore the latest updates to HTML and discuss how they can improve your website.

## New Input Types

HTML 5 has introduced several new input types to make it easier for developers to create a better user experience.
One of the most useful new input types is the range type. This allows users to select from a range of values, like selecting a volume level from 0 to 10. Other new input types include search, tel, url, and email. These are helpful for creating validating forms, ensuring that the information being entered by the user matches a certain type.
New input types also bring accessibility improvements. For example, screen readers can now distinguish between a range slider and a number field, making it easier for people with visual impairments to fill out forms.
HTML 5 also introduced the date and time picker type. This eliminates the need to use JavaScript libraries or other third-party solutions to create date and time pickers. Developers can now easily create one using the native HTML 5 input type.
Overall, the new input types make it easier for developers to create better user experiences, while also improving accessibility.

## Form Validation

Form validation is an important part of web development, allowing developers to ensure that users are submitting accurate and valid data. HTML5 has brought some much-needed improvements to form validation, making it simpler and more powerful than ever before.
One of the most significant updates to form validation in HTML5 is the new set of input types. These include things like "email", "url", "number", and "date". By using these new input types, the browser can now recognize certain types of data and validate them automatically. For example, when a user inputs an email address, the browser can check if it is a valid email address without any additional code.
HTML5 also introduces two new attributes for form elements: "required" and "pattern". The "required" attribute will indicate that a certain field must be filled out before the form can be submitted, while the "pattern" attribute can be used to define a pattern that the user's input must match. These attributes provide developers with more precise control over which values are acceptable.
Another feature of HTML5 form validation is the new set of validation messages. These messages will be displayed when a user enters invalid data into a field, providing a better user experience by giving the user feedback about what went wrong.
Overall, HTML5 provides a comprehensive set of features for form validation, making it easier and more intuitive for developers and users alike.

## Minor Syntax Changes

HTML5 comes with some minor syntax changes that can help streamline the coding process. The most notable change is the introduction of data attributes which allow developers to assign custom properties to HTML elements. This allows for more robust styling, scripting and can provide a better user experience.
Another small syntax change is the ability to use document type declarations on all HTML documents. This makes it easier to identify what version of HTML a page uses. For example, a page that uses HTML5 should include the following doctype declaration:
Other small changes include being able to omit the type attribute from script and style tags, as well as being able to shorten some existing attribute values.
These minor syntax changes might not seem like much, but they can help save time and make HTML code cleaner. This helps both the developers and end users by making websites easier to read and maintain.

## The progress Element

The progress element is a new HTML tag that allows developers to track the progress of tasks such as form submission, data loading, or page loading. This can be extremely useful for providing users with feedback on the status of their requests, or as a visual cue to indicate how far along they are in a given process.
The progress element works like an HTML5 tag, meaning it is self-contained and has no dependencies on external libraries. All you need to do is provide a starting value and an ending value (the maximum value) in order to get started. You can then use JavaScript to dynamically update the progress bar as the task progresses.
The progress element also provides several properties that allow you to customize the look and feel of the progress bar. This includes setting the color, size, thickness, and text associated with it. Additionally, you can set the direction in which the progress bar should move, either from left to right or from right to left.
Finally, the progress element is supported across all modern browsers, making it easy to implement in any web project. With this new HTML tag, developers have a powerful way of tracking the progress of tasks and providing users with feedback on the status of their requests.
